# TidyDataSet

This is the repossitori containing the final assignment of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course

The "run_analysis.R" script does the following:

1 Merge the training and the test data sets to create a new data set
2 Extract only the measurements of the mean and standard deviation
3 Name the activities in the data set
4 Labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5 Create a new data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject
